# Daily Sunspot Number

Inspired by [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/3ilzsi/daily_sunspot_number_1900_to_aug_2015_with_11/), I wanted to make the following changes:

* Expand to the full data set.
* Update the data set to most recent number provided.
* Create and provide an automated script in R to crunch new data as it comes in.
* Remove moving average, add aesthetic changes
